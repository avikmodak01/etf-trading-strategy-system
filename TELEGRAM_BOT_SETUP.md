# ü§ñ Telegram Bot Setup Guide

## Step 1: Create Your Telegram Bot

1. **Open Telegram** on your phone or computer
2. **Search for @BotFather** (official Telegram bot for creating bots)
3. **Start a chat** with @BotFather by clicking "Start" or sending `/start`

## Step 2: Create a New Bot

1. **Send command**: `/newbot`
2. **Choose a name** for your bot (e.g., "My ETF Trading Bot")
3. **Choose a username** for your bot (must end with 'bot', e.g., "my_etf_trading_bot")
4. **Copy the token** that @BotFather gives you

Example conversation:
```
You: /newbot
BotFather: Alright, a new bot. How are we going to call it? Please choose a name for your bot.

You: My ETF Trading Bot
BotFather: Good. Now let's choose a username for your bot. It must end in `bot`. Like this, for example: TetrisBot or tetris_bot.

You: my_etf_trading_bot
BotFather: Done! Congratulations on your new bot. You will find it at t.me/my_etf_trading_bot. 
You can now add a description, about section and profile picture for your bot, see /help for a list of commands.

Use this token to access the HTTP API:
1234567890:ABCdefGHIjklMNOpqrsTUVwxyz
Keep your token secure and store it safely, it can be used by anyone to control your bot.
```

## Step 3: Configure Your Bot Token

1. **Copy the token** from @BotFather (format: `1234567890:ABCdefGHIjklMNOpqrsTUVwxyz`)
2. **Open** `bot_config.py` in your project folder
3. **Replace** `YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE` with your actual token:

```python
BOT_TOKEN = "1234567890:ABCdefGHIjklMNOpqrsTUVwxyz"
```

## Step 4: Start Your Bot

```bash
# Activate the environment
source etf_trading_env/bin/activate

# Start the bot
python telegram_bot.py
```

You should see:
```
